| `user_saved_recipe` | ✅ | user_id, recipe_id, saved_at | User favorites |
| `feedback` | ✅ | id, user_id, item_type, item_id, rating, notes, created_at | User feedback system |

**Data types verified:**

- ✅ JSONB for structured data (steps, swaps, nutrition_summary, detected_hints)
- ✅ TIMESTAMPTZ for all timestamps
- ✅ VARCHAR with appropriate lengths
- ✅ NUMERIC for quantities and scores

---

### ✅ 3. Indexes Specified (GIN on Arrays, Trigram on Text)
**Status:** COMPLETE

All required indexes are implemented:

#### GIN Indexes on Arrays
```sql
✅ CREATE INDEX idx_workout_equipment ON workout_video USING GIN (equipment);
✅ CREATE INDEX idx_workout_body_part ON workout_video USING GIN (body_part);
```

#### Trigram Indexes on Text (requires pg_trgm extension)
```sql
✅ CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
✅ CREATE INDEX idx_workout_title_trgm ON workout_video USING GIN (title gin_trgm_ops);
✅ CREATE INDEX idx_recipe_title_trgm ON recipe USING GIN (title gin_trgm_ops);
```

#### JSONB Indexes
```sql
✅ CREATE INDEX idx_recipe_steps_gin ON recipe USING GIN (steps);
```

#### Foreign Key Indexes
```sql
✅ CREATE INDEX idx_image_query_user ON image_query(user_id);
✅ CREATE INDEX idx_retrieval_result_query ON retrieval_result(query_id);
```

#### Composite Primary Keys (implicit indexes)
- ✅ `recipe_ingredient (recipe_id, ingredient_id)`
- ✅ `user_saved_workout (user_id, workout_id)`
- ✅ `user_saved_recipe (user_id, recipe_id)`

#### Unique Constraints
- ✅ `users.email` UNIQUE
- ✅ `workout_video.youtube_id` UNIQUE
- ✅ `ingredient.name` UNIQUE
- ✅ `retrieval_result (query_id, rank)` UNIQUE (preserves ranking order)

---

### ✅ 4. Relationships Documented
**Status:** COMPLETE

All relationships are documented in `docs/erd.dbml` and implemented in SQL with proper foreign keys:

| Relationship | Type | Foreign Key | On Delete |
|--------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| `image_query.user_id → users.id` | Many-to-One | ✅ | SET NULL |
| `retrieval_result.query_id → image_query.id` | Many-to-One | ✅ | CASCADE |
| `user_saved_workout.user_id → users.id` | Many-to-Many | ✅ | CASCADE |
| `user_saved_workout.workout_id → workout_video.id` | Many-to-Many | ✅ | CASCADE |
| `user_saved_recipe.user_id → users.id` | Many-to-Many | ✅ | CASCADE |
| `user_saved_recipe.recipe_id → recipe.id` | Many-to-Many | ✅ | CASCADE |
| `recipe_ingredient.recipe_id → recipe.id` | Many-to-Many | ✅ | CASCADE |
| `recipe_ingredient.ingredient_id → ingredient.id` | Many-to-Many | ✅ | CASCADE |
| `feedback.user_id → users.id` | Many-to-One | ✅ | SET NULL |

**Referential integrity rules:**
- ✅ Cascade deletes for tightly coupled data (saved items, recipe ingredients)
- ✅ SET NULL for optional relationships (user queries, feedback)
- ✅ All relationships maintain data consistency

---

### ✅ 5. Extensions Enabled
**Status:** COMPLETE

Required PostgreSQL extensions are enabled in migration:

```sql
✅ CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;    -- For gen_random_uuid()
✅ CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;      -- For trigram search
```

---

### ✅ 6. Sample Data Provided
**Status:** COMPLETE (Bonus)

Migration includes realistic sample data for testing:
- ✅ 2 demo users (beginner and intermediate)
- ✅ 5 workout videos with varied levels, equipment, and body parts
- ✅ 5 recipes with JSONB steps and swaps
- ✅ 6 ingredients with recipe mappings
- ✅ Sample query, retrieval results, saved items, and feedback

---

## Additional Quality Checks

### Documentation Quality
- ✅ ERD includes clear notes and rationale
- ✅ Index purposes documented
- ✅ Constraints explained
- ✅ Review checklist provided in `docs/erd.md`

### Implementation Quality
- ✅ Migration runs successfully on PostgreSQL 16
- ✅ Flyway reports "Successfully applied 1 migration"
- ✅ All tables created without errors
- ✅ Sample data inserts successfully

### Best Practices
- ✅ UUIDs for scalability and distributed systems
- ✅ Default values reduce boilerplate
- ✅ Timestamps track creation/modification
- ✅ CHECK constraints enforce data validity (e.g., rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
- ✅ Normalized design (3NF) with proper join tables

---

## Recommended Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

While all acceptance criteria are met, these enhancements could be considered in future iterations:

### 1. Additional Indexes (Performance Optimization)
```sql
-- For feedback queries by item
CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_item ON feedback(item_type, item_id);

-- For ingredient reverse lookup (already noted in ERD)
CREATE INDEX idx_recipe_ingredient_ingredient ON recipe_ingredient(ingredient_id);

-- For time-based queries
CREATE INDEX idx_image_query_created ON image_query(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_created ON feedback(created_at DESC);
```

### 2. Materialized Views (Analytics)
```sql
-- Popular workouts by level
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_popular_workouts AS
SELECT level, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(view_count) as avg_views
FROM workout_video
GROUP BY level;
```

### 3. Audit Triggers (Compliance)
- Track who modified what and when
- Implement soft deletes for critical tables

### 4. Full-Text Search (Advanced)
```sql
-- If trigram search isn't sufficient
ALTER TABLE workout_video ADD COLUMN title_tsv tsvector;
CREATE INDEX idx_workout_title_fts ON workout_video USING GIN(title_tsv);
```

### 5. Partitioning (Scale)
- Partition `retrieval_result` by created_at (monthly) for high-volume scenarios
- Partition `feedback` similarly
