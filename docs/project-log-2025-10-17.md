# Today's Takeaway: Mastering Spring Transaction Management

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Project**: CameraFirst Fitness - Recipe Import Feature  
**Topic**: Solving the "Data Not Persisted" Mystery

---

## üéØ The Problem

Today I encountered a frustrating issue: my recipe import API was executing successfully, returning "43 recipes imported", but when I checked the database, it still showed only 5 recipes. The data was mysteriously disappearing!

```java
// This looked fine, but data wasn't saving
private void persistRecipe(Recipe recipe) {
    recipeRepository.save(recipe);
}
```

After importing, logs showed:
```
‚úÖ Imported recipe: Turkey Pot Pie
‚úÖ Imported recipe: Chicken Marsala
‚úÖ Imported recipe: ...43 recipes total
```

But database query returned: `COUNT(*) = 5` üò±

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The culprit was **Spring's @Transactional annotation not working on private methods**. Here's why:

**Spring uses AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) proxies** to manage transactions. When you call a public method with `@Transactional`, Spring creates a proxy that:
1. Starts a transaction
2. Calls your method
3. Commits or rolls back

But **proxies can't intercept private methods or self-invocations**. So this failed:

```java
public void importRecipes() {
    persistRecipe(data);  // Self-invocation!
}

@Transactional  // ‚ùå Won't work on private method
private void persistRecipe(Recipe recipe) {
    recipeRepository.save(recipe);
}
```

The `save()` operation only wrote to Hibernate's cache, never committed to PostgreSQL.

## üí° The Solution: TransactionTemplate

Instead of relying on `@Transactional`, I switched to **programmatic transaction management** using `TransactionTemplate`:

```java
// Constructor injection
public RecipeCuratorService(PlatformTransactionManager txManager) {
    this.transactionTemplate = new TransactionTemplate(txManager);
    this.transactionTemplate.setPropagationBehavior(
        TransactionDefinition.PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW
    );
}

// Usage
public void importRecipes() {
    transactionTemplate.executeWithoutResult(status -> {
        try {
            persistRecipe(recipe);
        } catch (JsonProcessingException ex) {
            throw new RecipePersistenceException(ex);
        }
    });
}
```

**Why this works:**
- ‚úÖ No proxy limitations - works with any method
- ‚úÖ Precise transaction control - each recipe gets its own transaction
- ‚úÖ Immediate commit - data persists even if later API calls fail
- ‚úÖ Proper rollback - RuntimeException triggers automatic rollback

---

## üìä Results

**Before**: 0 recipes persisted (despite executing 43 times)  
**After**: All 43 recipes successfully saved to database ‚úÖ

**Key improvement**: Using `PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW` ensures each recipe saves independently. If recipe #11 fails due to API quota, recipes 1-10 are already committed and safe.

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. Declarative vs Programmatic Transactions

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| `@Transactional` (Declarative) | Clean, less code | Proxy limitations |
| `TransactionTemplate` (Programmatic) | Full control, no limitations | More verbose |

### 2. Spring AOP Limitations

Remember: Spring proxies only work for:
- ‚úÖ Public/protected methods
- ‚úÖ External calls (through injected beans)
- ‚ùå NOT private methods
- ‚ùå NOT self-invocations

### 3. Exception Handling in Transactions

```java
// Custom exception to bridge checked ‚Üí unchecked
private static class RecipePersistenceException extends RuntimeException {
    RecipePersistenceException(Throwable cause) {
        super(cause);
    }
}
```

This wrapper converts `JsonProcessingException` (checked) into a RuntimeException, which Spring recognizes for automatic rollback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tools Used

```bash
# Check database count
docker exec postgres psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recipe;"

# Monitor logs
tail -f /tmp/app.log | grep "Imported recipe"

# Enable transaction debugging
logging.level.org.springframework.transaction=DEBUG
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

Tomorrow, after the Spoonacular API quota resets, I'll test the full import pipeline. The code is ready and properly handles:
- Independent transactions per recipe
- Graceful degradation on API failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

---

## üí≠ Final Thoughts

This bug taught me that **understanding the framework's internals is crucial**. Simply adding `@Transactional` isn't always enough - you need to understand how Spring's proxy mechanism works and when to use programmatic alternatives.

**Key takeaway**: When `@Transactional` doesn't work, reach for `TransactionTemplate`. It's more verbose but gives you complete control without proxy limitations.
